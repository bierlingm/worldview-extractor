## Core Worldview

### Metaphysics & Reality

1. **Reality is symbolic/linguistic** - The universe operates through patterns, symbols, and meaning (Logos). Language isn't just communication but the substrate of reality itself.

2. **Consciousness shapes reality** - Perception, attention, and belief literally structure experience. "Luck" is reframed as skill in pattern recognition. What you invest "psychic energy" in, you manifest.

3. **Hidden architecture of creation** - There's an underlying order (the "watchtower," sacred geometry, the Two Witnesses pattern) that reveals itself to those prepared to see it. Jung's work on synchronicity is taken seriously.

### Money & Power

4. **Money as belief/magic** - Money is "crystallized belief" - its value comes from collective faith, making it fundamentally magical/religious in nature. Financial systems are power structures built on shared hallucination.

5. **Power projection through symbols** - Institutions (states, religions, corporations) project power through symbolic manipulation - flags, rituals, currencies. Those who understand this can work with it.

### Epistemology

6. **Anti-materialist** - Rejects naive materialism. Consciousness, meaning, and pattern are primary; matter is secondary or derivative.

7. **Gnostic/esoteric leanings** - References to Abraxas, theophany, apocalypsis as "unveiling." Knowledge is revelation, not accumulation. Reality has layers that reveal themselves.

8. **Synchronicity as signal** - Meaningful coincidences aren't noise but signal. Learning to read them is a skill that improves with practice.

### Ethics/Practice

9. **Minimalism** - Doesn't care for travel, entertainment, excess luxury. Values simplicity.

10. **Pattern recognition as spiritual practice** - Developing the ability to see correspondences and meaning is the path to understanding. The world constantly speaks if you learn to listen.
